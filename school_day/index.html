<h2>Afternoon Program</h2>

<p><a href="/about/teachers">Teacher Johana Barahona</a> leads our afternoon program on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 12:30 to 3:30 for up to 10 children on each day.</p>

<p>Children in the afternoon program spend extra time outdoors exploring Glen Canyon and the school garden. We then have circle time with stories and songs, nap/quiet time, a healthy snack, and finish up with an art or science project.</p>

<p>The smaller class size enables the teachers to hone in on the needs and interests of the children, fosters unique bonds between the children, and helps them better focus and cooperate as a group. </p>

<p>Parents whose children are enrolled in the program take turns assisting Johana as the parent-teacher. </p>
