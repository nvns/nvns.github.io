            About Noe Valley Nursery School
          </h1>
          <p>
            Noe Valley Nursery School was started by a group of neighborhood parents in 1969.
            It has been a successful venture; we have been learning and enjoying ourselves ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noe Valley Cooperative Nursery School is a community of parents interested in taking part
            in their children's preschool experience. Each family shares in the planning and operation
            of the school. Parents staff the school under the guidance of Susan Edwards, our director since 2006.
          </p>
          <p>
            This school, like all co-operative preschools, is where your child
            can take those first steps into the world while still holding your
            hand. You come to school, too. You will be amazed and delighted at the
            benefits which you, the parent, will receive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The school is a proud and active member of the California Council of Parent Participation
            Nursery Schools, serving families of Noe and Eureka Valley, Bernal Heights, Potrero Hill,
            Mission and other San Francisco neighborhoods since 1969.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a place where you can be your best and it will be enormously
            appreciated and recognized. It is a place in which children extend the
            love they have for their parents to other childrens parents, and
            where parents extend the love they have for their children to other
            peoples children. It is a rich and healthy environment for everyone
            involved; the parents, the children and the teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
            We all learn here, and then we pass it on.

            <h1>The school day</h1>
            <p>
              A normal school day is from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Working parents arrive at 8:30am to prepare the activities of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all come together at 10:00 a.m. each day for a snack, which is provided by a member family. Snack is followed circle time with a story and music, lead by Susan (our Director) or one of the parents. Susan periodically takes the children on a nature walk down Glen Canyon or to the Community Garden to visit our gardening plot where we plant and harvest local fruits and vegetables. We come together again at 12:00 noon for lunch, which is brought from home.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Tuesdays, music educator Andrew Gomez joins us for circle time on Tuesdays. See more info about this on our arts page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every Thursday, children have the option of going to the pool at the Janet Pomeroy Center to swim. The pool is warm, shallow and great for beginners, and there is a trained lifeguard on duty. Working parents drive the children to and from the pool.
