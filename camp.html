              NVNS Summer Camp 2016 with Teachers Annie and Eva
            </h2>
            <p>
              Noe Valley Nursery School is offering seven weeks of Summer Camp fun this
              year. Each week a maximum of 10 kids from 3-5 years old will spend wonderful
              days with Teacher Annie or Teacher Eva, plus an Assistant Teacher. The camp day will run from
              9AM to 1PM. Parents are asked to pack a lunch for their child, while snack will
              be provided by the school.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Camp Director/Teacher: Annie Bertram (Weeks 1-3)
            </h3>
            <p>
              In 2012, Annie obtained her Master's Degree in Early Childhood Education
              at George Fox University, located just outside of Portland, Oregon. She
              has taught at Noe Valley Nursery School for three years and served as
              Director for the school's fun and successful summer camp from 2013 to 2015.
              She is also in charge of the <a href='schoolday.html#PM_Program'>afternoon program</a> at NVNS. Annie comes from
              a large family of teachers and has grown up in various classroom
              environments. She loves going on hikes and preparing creative activities
              for the children. Annie is excited for what is to come this summer and
              can't wait to continue the long-standing traditions and community of Noe
              Valley Nursery School.  Annie will be teaching the first, three weeks of camp in June.
            </p>

              Camp Teacher: Eva Barahona (Weeks 4-7)
            </h3>
            <p>
	      Eva joined Noe Valley Nursery School in January as our new Director 
	      after our previous and long-serving Director, Susan Edwards, retired at age 70.
              Eva is a Master's-level preschool teacher with 20+ years experience as a 
	      preschool director.  Eva is excited to be teaching the final, four weeks of 
	      camp in late June and for most of July, excluding the week of July 4th.

              Week 1 (June 6-10) Math Madness:
            </h3>
            <p>
              We will discover new games and challenges by using special materials 
	      such as toys, songs, and puzzles to take a closer look at the world of 
	      math. While doing so, we will uncover numbers, patterns, geometry, and 
	      measurement. We will also learn more about counting, categorizing, and shapes.

            <p>
              This unique opportunity will allow children to develop literacy through 
	      books, stories, and acting. We will be using props such as puppets and 
	      costumes as well. The focus of this week is fun with comprehension. 
	      Together we will read, tell, and discuss stories. Children will also get 
	      the chance to create new stories of their own!

              Week 3 (June 20-24) Nature and the World Around Us:

            <p>
              Join us on an adventure as we take a closer look at nature and science 
	      in our very own backyard, inspired by Glen Canyon and the garden 
	      around Noe Valley Nursery School. Learning through play and careful 
	      observation, campers will explore their connection to nature and to each 
	      other. The children will learn to foster a deeper appreciation and respect 
	      for nature and develop their sense of stewardship. You can expect your child 
	      to come home tired, dirty, and with lots of adventures to tell you about!

              Week 4 (June 27- July 1) Exploring Art:
            </h3>
            <p>
              Together we will nurture creativity through art by exploring color, line, 
	      form, design, space, and texture. We will also examine the works of 
	      famous artists who have had a major influence on art as we know it. Children 
	      will have the opportunity to express themselves through art by drawing, 
	      painting, stamping, sculpturing, and collaging. As a group we will create 
	      individual pieces, as well as one giant masterpiece together. Throughout the 
	      week, we will incorporate our whole bodies with music and dance.
            </p>
