        <h2>Themes</h2>

        <h3>Week 1 (June 10-14) Math Madness:</h3>

        We will discover new games and challenges by using special materials such as toys, songs, and puzzles to take a closer look at the world of math. While doing so, we will uncover numbers, patterns, geometry, and measurement. We will also learn more about counting, categorizing, and shapes.

        <h3>Week 2 (June 17-21) Words with Friends:</h3>

        This unique opportunity will allow children to develop literacy through books, stories, and acting. We will be using props such as puppets and costumes as well. The focus of this week is fun with comprehension. Together we will read, tell, and discuss stories. Children will also get the chance to create new stories of their own!

        <h3>Week 3 (June 24-28) Nature and the World Around Us:</h3>
        Join us on an adventure as we take a closer look at nature and science in our very own backyard, inspired by Glen Canyon and the garden around Noe Valley Nursery School. Learning through play and careful observation, campers will explore their connection to nature and to each other. The children will learn to foster a deeper appreciation and respect for nature and develop their sense of stewardship. You can expect your child to come home tired, dirty, and with lots of adventures to tell you about!

        <h3>Week 4 (July 8-12) Exploring Art:</h3>

        Together we will nurture creativity through art by exploring color, line, form, design, space, and texture. We will also examine the works of famous artists who have had a major influence on art as we know it. Children will have the opportunity to express themselves through art by drawing, painting, stamping, sculpturing, and collaging. As a group we will create individual pieces, as well as one giant masterpiece together. Throughout the week, we will incorporate our whole bodies with music and dance.
