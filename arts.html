              <h2>NVNS Dance program with Mary Carbonara</h2>
              <p>
                A parent-member of the Noe Valley Cooperative Nursery School for 5 years (2008-2013), Mary Carbonara teaches dance weekly and during the NVNS Summer Camp at Noe Valley Nursery School.
              </p>
              <p>
                In NVNS Dance, students explore rhythm, space, shape, pathway, time, and force, discover creative problem solving through movement, and experience dancing with a partner, in groups and independently, all while enjoying a bold use of space and great music. Designed specifically for preschoolers, Mary's class is playfully challenging.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mary has been teaching dance for 24 years, working with children, young adults, adult beginners and aspiring and seasoned professionals. In addition to her work at NVNS, she teaches dance to elementary school students as part of the after-school enrichment and summer camp programs at Miraloma and Sunnyside Elementary Schools. As a member of the faculty of Alonzo King LINES Dance Center, Mary teaches all levels of dance technique as well as Dance Pedagogy through the LINES Ballet Training Program, mentoring teaching apprentices at Presidio Middle School, DeMarillac Academy and the Tenderloin Boys & Girls Club. She has taught on the faculties of San Francisco Ballet, ODC School, Shawl Anderson Dance Center, Mills College, San Jose State University, East Carolina University, UC Davis, and around the world, including New York, Chicago, Tallahassee, Tokyo and Kolkata, India.

              <h2>Dancing with Teacher Gudrun</h2>
              <p>On Tuesdays we have an optional yoga/dance class filled with fun and creative activities. The yoga segment encourages self­ expression, body and breath awareness, and positive thinking in a noncompetitive environment. The kids will work on building motor coordination, strength, flexibility, concentration and calmness, but most importantly have fun together with imaginary play, craft, dance and storytelling! (Mats provided) The creative dance segment includes a specific dance concept (self space/general space, speed, directions etc.), developmental movement patterns called BrainDance (http://creativedance.org/about/braindance/), movement exploration though improvisation, an obstacle course and a lot of dancing together.</p>

              <p>Gudrun is a contemporary dancer and choreographer, a licensed Next Generation Yoga teacher for kids, certificated prenatal/postnatal yoga teacher, infant massage teacher and has completed Anne Green Gilbert’s foundational course in Brain-Compatible Dance Teaching Methods. Movement has been Gudrun’s passion in life, she has been dancing for as long as she can remember. When Gudrun became a parent and learned more about child development, she was blown away by how big a role movement plays in brain development, and how dance and yoga can support physical, intellectual, emotional and creative development.</p>

              <h2><a name='singing'></a>Singing with Teacher Andrew</h2>
              <p>
                Teacher Andrew brings his guitar & a bevy of instruments (egg shakers, a parachute, scarves, and more!) to share with kids & adults alike each Friday, as he leads the parents in a number of musical activities, including raucous sing-a-longs, easy call-and-response patterns, and tonal games. Children are free to dance, move, sit quietly, or do whatever the music makes them feel (so long as it is safe and not disruptive to other children!), as the adults participate & teach through modeling musical behaviors.
              </p>
              <p>
                The program is rooted in the knowledge that children are inherently musical, they learn by watching & imitating, and there are few things as satisfying as making music with friends & family, regardless of one's skill level.
