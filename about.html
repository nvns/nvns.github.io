            <h2>About Noe Valley Nursery School</h2>
            <p>
              Noe Valley Nursery School was started by a group of neighborhood parents in 1969. It has been a successful venture; we have been learning and enjoying ourselves ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              Noe Valley Cooperative Nursery School is a community of parents interested in taking part in their children's preschool experience. Each family shares in the planning and operation of the school. Parents staff the school under the guidance of Susan Edwards, our director since 2006.
            </p>
            <p>
              This school, like all co-operative preschools, is where your child can take those first steps into the world while still holding your hand. You come to school, too. You will be amazed and delighted at the benefits which you, the parent, will receive.
            </p>
            <p>
              The school is a proud and active member of the California Council of Parent Participation Nursery Schools, serving families of Noe and Eureka Valley, Bernal Heights, Potrero Hill, Mission and other San Francisco neighborhoods since 1969.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a place where you can be your best and it will be enormously appreciated and recognized. It is a place in which children extend the love they have for their parents to other childrens parents, and where parents extend the love they have for their children to other peoples children. It is a rich and healthy environment for everyone involved; the parents, the children and the teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all learn here, and then we pass it on.
