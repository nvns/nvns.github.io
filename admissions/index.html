        <p>First, attend a Parent Information Night where parents and the Director will provide information about ourphilosophy, curriculum, and family responsibilities.</p>

        <p>Next, schedule a visit to the school with your child, where you can observe your child in the school environment and have a one-on-one meeting with the Director.</p>

        <p>Our <a href="mailto:membership@noevalleynurseryschool.com">membership coordinator</a> will contact you when a spot is available. If there is no current opening, your child will be placed into the waiting pool.</p>
