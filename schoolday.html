              <h1>School Day</h1>
              <p>
                A normal school day is from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Working parents arrive at 8:30am to prepare the activities of the day.
              </p>
              <p>
                We all come together at 10:00 a.m. each day for a snack, which is provided by a member family. Snack is followed circle time with a story and music, lead by Susan (our Director) or one of the parents. Susan periodically takes the children on a nature walk down Glen Canyon or to the Community Garden to visit our gardening plot where we plant and harvest local fruits and vegetables. We come together again at 12:00 noon for lunch, which is brought from home.
              </p>
              <p>
                On Tuesdays, music educator Andrew Gomez joins us for circle time on Tuesdays. See more info about this on our arts page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every Thursday, children have the option of going to the pool at the Janet Pomeroy Center to swim. The pool is warm, shallow and great for beginners, and there is a trained lifeguard on duty. Working parents drive the children to and from the pool.

              <h1>Afternoon Program</h1>
              <p>
                Our afternoon program is a new opportunity for parents and students at Noe Valley Nursery School. It is available for children who are enrolled in the morning program at NVNS, and it extends the school day until 3:30 PM.
              </p>
              <p>
                The program is led by Annie Bertram, who achieved her master's degree in Early Childhood Education at George Fox University. She currently works with the morning class, and is dedicated to helping every student achieve his or her developmental goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                The afternoon program provides a supportive and creative learning environment that encompasses our school's play-based philosophy while enhancing kindergarten readiness. With a smaller class size in the afternoon, the children are able to focus and cooperate together as a group when playing or working on projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                The afternoon program is offered as an extension to NVNS students. We are currently accepting applications for 2014/2015 school year, and hope that you will come join us!

              <h1>Parent Participation</h1>
              <p>
                Member families are required to participate in the planning and operation of the school. A thorough description of these responsibilities will be given when you join the school. The minimum responsibilities to the school are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  At least one parent must work at the school from 8:30 a.m. until 1:00 p.m., either 3, 4, or 5 days per month, depending on the number of days per week their child attends. Workdays will always be on the same day of the week.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At least one parent must attend 2 parent meetings per month, which fall on the 1st and 3rd Thursday evenings, at 7:30 p.m., and are held at the school.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At least one parent must actively participate in all fundraising activities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each family must participate in school-wide maintenance days which is currently 1 1/2 hours per family, every other month. The first and last maintenance days of the year are mandatory for all members.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each family will be scheduled in advance to work in the kitchen every 6 weeks or so. Working in the kitchen includes providing snack for the 10:00 a.m. snack time, as well as cleaning the kitchen and bathrooms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each member family is required to hold a job for the school. This job can be anything from President of the Board, to Scheduling, to Laundry. New families will be asked to select a job from a list provided at the first parent meeting of the year.
                </li>
